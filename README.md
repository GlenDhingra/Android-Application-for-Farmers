# Android-Application-for-Farmers
Developed during SPIT Hackathon

Overview:

This project was developed as part of a Hackathon hosted by Sardar Patel Institute Of Technology. The primary goal of this project was to create an Android application that provides valuable services and information to farmers. We developed this application using Android Studio, Java, Firebase Machine Learning Kit, and XML.

Key Features:

Multilingual Voice-Enabled Chatbot: We designed a voice-enabled chatbot that allows farmers to interact with the application in their preferred language. Farmers can ask questions, get information about the weather, inquire about the current month's vegetable prices in their region, and even get directions to nearby places, all through natural voice interactions.

SMS Communication System: We implemented an SMS system that enables farmers to communicate and resolve their issues efficiently. This feature aims to provide a direct and accessible channel for farmers to seek assistance and support.

Geo-Location Services: The application also includes geo-location services, allowing farmers to find nearby places, markets, or support centers with the help of integrated maps.
